# Smart Fertilizer Assistant

The **Smart Fertilizer Assistant** is a web/mobile application designed to help farmers identify the best fertilizers and pesticides for their crops based on **soil Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)** or **crop type**. This application ensures that farmers can make informed decisions about which products to use, protecting both the soil health and their crops, while boosting farm productivity.

## Features

- **Soil TDS-Based Recommendations**: Farmers can input their soil's TDS level, and the app will recommend suitable fertilizers and pesticides that match the soil conditions to avoid overuse or damage.
  
- **Crop Type-Based Suggestions**: If farmers don't know their soil TDS, they can enter the **crop type** and receive recommended products tailored for that specific crop.

- **Filters**: Allows users to filter recommendations by:
  - **Price**: Helping farmers choose affordable solutions.
  - **Soil Type**: For example, loamy, clay, or sandy soil.
  - **Crop Type**: Suggestions based on crop requirements.

- **Multilingual Support**: The app supports both **English** and **Hindi** to cater to a wide range of farmers.

- **Usage Instructions**: Each product recommendation comes with clear **usage instructions** to ensure proper application and effectiveness.

## Importance of the Project

### üå± **Sustainable Farming Practices**
Farming is highly dependent on the quality of the soil. Using the wrong fertilizers can lead to soil degradation, nutrient imbalances, and poor crop yields. The **Smart Fertilizer Assistant** ensures that farmers use the right products, preventing soil damage while promoting healthy crop growth.

### üí∞ **Cost-Effective Solutions**
Farmers often struggle with the high cost of agricultural inputs. By providing recommendations based on affordability, soil type, and crop needs, this app helps reduce unnecessary expenses. It promotes efficient fertilizer use, preventing overuse, which not only saves money but also improves sustainability.

### üìä **Informed Decision Making**
Farmers often lack access to expert advice on which fertilizers or pesticides to use. This app empowers them with data-driven suggestions, based on scientifically proven methods and personalized recommendations. With the integration of TDS and crop type, farmers get the most relevant information for their needs.

### üåç **Boosting Agricultural Productivity**
By providing precise product recommendations, the app increases the likelihood of optimal fertilizer use, which leads to healthier crops, higher yields, and better productivity overall.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Soil TDS**: If the farmer knows the soil's Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) level, they can input the value into the app. Based on this information, the app suggests fertilizers and pesticides with the appropriate range for that soil.
   
2. **Enter Crop Type**: If the farmer doesn't know the soil's TDS, they can simply input the crop type (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Tomato, etc.), and the app will provide recommendations based on the needs of that particular crop.

3. **Filtering Options**: After the recommendations are made, users can apply filters such as:
   - **Price Range**
   - **Soil Type (Loamy, Sandy, Clay)**
   - **Crop Type**

4. **Product Recommendations**: Each recommended product includes:
   - Name
   - Price
   - Type (Fertilizer, Pesticide, Micronutrient, etc.)
   - Usage Instructions

5. **Multilingual Support**: Users can switch between **English** and **Hindi** to make the app more accessible.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js (for future implementation if backend integration is needed)
- **API Integration**: Can be integrated with agricultural product databases for live data
- **Languages**: English and Hindi
